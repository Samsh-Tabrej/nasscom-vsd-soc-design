# Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning
Welcome to the OpenLane workshop organized by VSD in collaboration with NASSCOM! In this session, we will explore the complete process of designing an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) using the OpenLane ASIC flow. Starting from the Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, we will progress through various key stages to ultimately generate a Graphical Data System (GDS) file.

# Curriculum
- Introduction to open-source EDA tools and 130nm PDKs <br/>
- Floorplanning and standard cell design <br/>
- Designing and characterizing a library cell <br/>
- Pre-layout timing analysis and clock tree synthesis <br/>
- The final Leap: From RTL2GDS
